{"id":1109044,"first_name":"Renée","last_name":"Robyn","bio":"Growing up surrounded by the vast prairie of the Canadian north and tales of faraway places, Renée Robyn has chased the perfect backdrop around the world. Approaching photography like a treasure hunter, her compositions are uniquely cinematic, often becoming pieces of a bigger world represented beyond reality. Renée’s style is easily recognizable and distinctly her own. Expertly blending fact, fiction, and a little digital alchemy, she has worked with industry-leading brands like Wacom, Viewsonic, Corel, Capture One, and Intel.\r\n\r\nComfortable facing down gale force winds, climbing fog-shrouded mountains or fast pace commercial studios, her work is impressive and committed. An expert retoucher, Renée applies the same level of commitment to post-processing leveraging her mastery of color theory, editing, light, and shadow in the digital realm of Photoshop.\r\n\r\nShe has presented lectures around the world, including PhotoPlus, WPPI, Photokina, CreativeLive, ProEdu, and more.","created_at":"2024-03-27T16:18:28.442Z","user_id":194511729,"title":"Renée Robyn travels the globe in pursuit of the perfect photographic backdrop, blending fact and fiction in her uniquely cinematic compositions.","slug":"renee-robyn","avatar_url":"https://import.cdn.thinkific.com/114242/x6F7EVV4RFSX4r6yH0dS_Inst%20Image.png","email":""}
